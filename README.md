# Hike-Mate
Hike Mate is an unreleased Android app which was created as a bachelor project. 

It's target is to let user know, which landscape trail they are on. It's method of use is really simple. 
All that user has to do is make photo of a trail sign (or choose color from a list).
Afterwards Hike Mate checks his global position and with given coordinates estimates which landscape trail user is at. 
After finding corresponding trail, application shows basic info of the route (like elevation or length), map with the course of the route and elevation plot.
